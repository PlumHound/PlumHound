# PlumHound - BloodHoundAD Report Engine for Security Teams
Released as Proof of Concept for Blue and Purple teams to more effectively use BloodHoundAD in continual security life-cycles by utilizing the BloodHoundAD pathfinding engine to identify Active Directory security vulnerabilities resulting from business operations, procedures, policies and legacy service operations.

PlumHound operates by wrapping BloodHoundAD's powerhouse graphical Neo4J backend cypher queries into operations-consumable reports.  Analyzing the output of PlumHound can steer security teams in identifying and hardening common Active Directory configuration vulnerabilities and oversights.

## Release and call to Action
The initial PlumHound code was released on May 14th, 2020 during a Black Hills Information Security webcast, A Blue Teams Perspective on Red Team Tools.  The webcast was recorded and is available on YouTube. [A Blue Team's Perspective on Red Team Tools](https://youtu.be/0mIN2OU5hQEs).


The PlumHound Framework yields itself to community involvement in the creation and proliferation of "TaskLists" (work) that can be shared and used across different organizations.  TaskLists contain jobs for PlumHound to do (queries to run, reports to write).  A second PlumHound community repo has been created to allow for the open sharing of TaskLists (see [Plumhound-Tasks](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/PlumHound-Tasks))

## Background
A client of ours working on hardening their Active Directory infrastructure asked us about vulnerabilities that can be found by using BloodHound.  They had heard of the effectiveness of BloodHoundAD in Red-Team's hands and was told that BloodHound would identify all types of security mis-alignments and mis-configurations in their Active Directory environment.  We helped them through analysis of their BloodHound dataset and it became quickly evident that BloodHoundAD's pathfinding graphical database was not designed for the fast-passed analytical security team accustom to reading reports and action items.  

In fact, one of our cypher queries determined that 96% of their 3000 users had a path to Domain Admin with an average of just 4 steps.  However, that graphical query rendered over 10,000 paths to Domain Admin.  Finding the actual cause of the short-paths to DA wasn't as easy as just loading data into BloodHound or putting Cobalt Strike on Auto-Pilot with BloodHound Navigation.  
Hence, PlumHound was created out of a need to retrieve consumable data from BloodHoundAD's pathfinding engine.  Data that could yield itself to inferring actionable work for security teams to harden their environments.

## Sample Reports
 We include some sample reports in this respository, however the data represents a fictious small Active Directory deployment atypical of a production environment.  The default tasks tasklist will produce reports with ease.  Here are a sample of some less-exciting reports generated from a small lab environment.  A few samples of produced reports are shown below.  
 
 The archive of sample reports is found here: [SampleReports](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound/raw/master/docs/SampleReports.zip)

 # PlumHound Examples
Use the default username, password, server, and execute the "Easy" task, to test connectivity.  This will output all Active Directory user objects from the Neo4J database.
```shell
python3 PlumHound.py --easy
```
## Default Task List and Default Credentials 
Execute PlumHound with the Default TaskList using Default Credentials (neo4j:neo4jneo4j) and Database.
```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks
```
## Default Task List, Specified Neo4j Server and Quiet Output
The same, but quiet the output (-v 0), specify the Neo4J server, username, and password instead of using defaults.
```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks -s "bolt://127.0.0.1:7687" -u "neo4j" -p "neo4jneo4j" -v 0
```

## Path Analyzer (BlueHound Module) 

### Option #1
Using label. The supported labels are `User`, `Group`, `Computer`, `OU` and `GPO`. This function will assume the target group is "DOMAIN ADMINS".

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -ap user
```
**NOTE:** The above syntax implies you are using the default values for `sever`, `user` and `password` or that you have hard-coded them in the script.  

### Option #2 
specify `start node` and `end node` 
```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -ap "domain users@example.com" "domain admins@example.com"
```
**NOTE:** To use BlueHound Path Analyzer logic you need to get a copy of the Python script from https://github.com/scoubi/BlueHound  

## Busiest Path (BlueHound Module)
The Busiest Path(s) function takes two parameters 

### Busiest Shortest Path to DA
Find the shortest path that give users Domain Admin (top 5)
```
PlumHound.py -bp short 5
```

### Busiest All Path to DA
Find the busiest path irregardless of length (top 5) to give users Domain Admin
```
PlumHound.py -bp all 5
```

                        Neo4J Database Password
  --UseEnc              Use encryption when connect
```
PlumHound paramters are set by default.  You can override the default by including the argument.

| Argument/Parameter | Default |
|----------|----------|
| SERVER | bolt://localhost:7687 |
| USERNAME | neo4j |
| PASSWORD | neo4jneo4j |



# HTML Report Design Output and Variables
HTML output includes the ability to use HTML Headers, Footers, and CSS to modify the design of the report.  Additionaly, variables can be added to the HTML Header and Footer files that are replaced at runtime. 
```plaintext
HTML:
  Options for HTML Output (For single queries or TaskLists

  --HTMLHeader HTMLHEADER
                        HTML Header (file) of Report
  --HTMLFooter HTMLFOOTER
                        HTML Footer (file) of Report
  --HTMLCSS HTMLCSS     Specify a CSS template for HTML Output
```

| Argument/Parameter | Default  |
|-----------|----------|
| HTMLHeader  | templates/head.html |
| HTMLFooter  | templates/tail.html |
| HTMLCSS  | templates/html.css |


| Variable                | Output                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| --------PH_TITLE------- | Report Tile from --Title or TaskList/Job |
| --------PH_DATE------- | Python date.today()|

This allows the HTML output to be dynamic and tailored to your specification.



# TaskList Files
The PlumHound Repo includes a sample TaskList that exports some basic BloodHoundAD Cypher queries to an HTML Report.  The included tasks\Default.tasks sample shows the basic syntax of the TaskList files.  The TaskList Files allow PlumHound to be fully scripted with batch jobs after the SharpHound dataset has been imported not BloodHoundAD on Neo4j. 
Looking for more tasks and templates? Checkout [PlumHound-Tasks ](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/PlumHound-Tasks)for the community driven marketplace of PlumHound reporting taskslists and report designs.


## TaskList File Syntax
The TaskList file syntax is as follows. Note that any cypher query containing a double quote must be modified to use a single quote instead of double.

```plaintext
["Report Title","[Output-Format]","[Output-File]","[CypherQuery]"]
```

Output-Format options for TaskLists:
* **HTML**: Generates a HTML Report
* **CSV**: Generates a CSV of data
* **HTMLCSV**: Generates both an HTML report and CSV data.  
  * NOTE: DO not include a file-extension in the Output-File paramter.

Additional Modules in TaskLists:
* Report Index: to use the Report-Index module in a TaskList, use CypherQuery "REPORT-INDEX"

## TaskList Sample: default.tasks
The default.tasks file includes multiple tasks that instruct PlumHound to create reports using the specified "HTML" output format, output filename, and specific BloodHoundAD Neo4JS cypher Query. 
See the Tasks mode below in the Execution modes section for additional information. 
```
PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks
```


# Execution Modes

There are multiple execution modes to get PlumHound to do work. 
* Tasks Mode
* Single Query Mode
* BusiestPath Mode (BlueHound Module)
* AnalyzePath Mode (BlueHound Module)

## Tasks Mode
By specifying a task list, PlumHound can be programmed to run multiple cypher queries and export to multiple formats.
For more information on the tasks file, see the section above.



 ![](docs/images/ph14.gif) 



## Single Query Mode
This mode allows you to run a single query and export to standard output, HTML, or CSV.

### Single Query with Standard Output (Normal Verbosity)

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10"

       PlumHound 1.4

```

### Single Query with Standard Output (Quiet)

By turning the verbosity to zero, this can act as a direct Neo4J handler for queries.

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10" -v 0
on 1:
on 1: n.name                    n.displayname

on 1:
         Executing Tasks |██████████████████████████████████████████████████| Tasks 1 / 1  in 0.2s (4.33/s)

```

The single query can also be used to generate HTML reports instead of outputting to STDOUT.

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10" --title "Domain Users (Limit 10)" --of "DomainUserstest.html" --op "reports//" --ox HTML
```

## Busiest Path (BlueHound Module)
The Busiest Path(s) function takes two parameters 
1- `all` or `short` either you want to use `shortestpath` or `allshorteshpaths` algorithym. 
2- The number of results you want to return. ex: Top 5

```plaintext
PlumHound.py -bp short 5

[49, 'IT00435@BTV.ORG']
[49, 'IT00333@BTV.ORG']
[*]Tasks Generation Completed
Tasks: []
```


## Analyze Path (BlueHound Module)
The Analyze Path takes either a `label` or a `start node` and `end node` and loop through all the paths finding which relationship(s) need to be broken in order to break the whole path. This is useful when you want to provide your AD Admins with concrete actions they can take in order to improuve your overall AD Security Posture.

# Additional Modules
Additional modules will be documented here. 

## Report Indexer Moodule
The report indexer builds an HTML report of all the completed jobs.  Add the following job to a task list.
The parameter = "REPORT-INDEX" instructs PlumHound to generate an HTML index of all the successfully exported tasks in that run of tasks. 

### Report Indexer Task Syntax

```
["Report Index","HTML","Reports.html","REPORT-INDEX"]
```

## TaskZipper Module
The Taskzipper module will create a zipfile of all of the reports generated from a tasklist.  Be sure that the Zip Module is included as the last task in a last list.
The paramter = "ZIP-TASKS" instructs PlumHound to generate a ZIP file of all the sucessfuly exported tatsks in that run of tasks.

### TaskZipper Task Syntax
```
["Zip Tasks","ZIP","Reports.zip","ZIP-TASKS"]
```

# Logging
By default, PlumHound generates a log in file log\PlumHound.log
